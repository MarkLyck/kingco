            </p>

            <h3 className="left-title">non-EEA applicants</h3>
            <p className="section-text">
                Non EEA Nationals wishing to take up an economic activity in Gibraltar should, in case of those intending to
                set up in businesses, contact the Commercial Director of the Department of Trade and Industry in the first
                instance. Those seeking to take up employment should approach the Employment and Training Board.<br /><br />

                Visas to enter Gibraltar will not be authorised unless it can be established that there is a genuine intention
                and ability to set up a business. In the same way a visa for a person intending to take up employment will
                not be authorised unless the Employment and Training Board confirms that there would be no objection in
                principle to the issue of a work permit.<br /><br />
                
                Persons who do not wish to pursue an economic activity in Gibraltar would, under the provisions of the
                Immigration Asylum & Refugee Act, need to show that they are of good character and that it would be in
                the general interest of Gibraltar that they should be issued with a residence permit. Requests for residency
                in this category are processed by this office and this is discretionary provision under section 19C of the
                Immigration, Asylum and Refugee Act. Individuals are expected to provide evidence as to their good character, financial standing and good health. Although ownership of accommodation is not absolute
                requirement, it is considered an advantage. However a final commitment to purchase should not be entered
                into before approval in principle to the issue of residence permit is given.<br /><br />

                Residency permits are normally issued for a maximum period of one year and are renewed annually
                provided the Immigration Authorities are satisfied that there has been no material change of circumstances.
                An EEA national has the right to enter Gibraltar on production of a valid passport or national identity card,
                and remain for 3 months in order to seek employment or to establish himself under any other qualifying
                category. An EEA national who exercises EEA rights as a qualified person and establishes himself in
                Gibraltar acquires the right to reside by virtue of this and must register for residence during or after residing
                in Gibraltar for 3 months. Residence documentation will have a renewable validity of 5 years although a
                civilian registration card will be issued for 12 months in the first instance.<br /><br />

                The families (whether themselves EEA or non-EEA nationals) of established qualified persons also have
                the right to reside provided the qualified person has suitable accommodation for them. Family members
                must also apply for residence documentation after being in Gibraltar for 3 months. The residence
                documentation to family members will have the same validity as the documentation issued to the qualified
                person. The non-EEA visa requiring family members of a qualified person will need to obtain an EEA family
                permit in order to enter in Gibraltar.<br /><br />

                EEA nationals who are self-sufficient and who do not intend to take up economic activity in Gibraltar also
                have the right to reside as qualified persons provided they and their dependants have sufficient resources
                to avoid becoming a burden on the social assistance system of Gibraltar, are covered by sickness
                insurance in respect of all risks and have suitable accommodation.<br /><br />

                Retired self-sufficient UK nationals who are in receipt of a state pension in the UK may not need to take out
                sickness insurance if they are included in the list of pensioners who are entitled to medical treatment under
                the Gibraltar Health Authority: Such persons who wish to be included on the list should contact the
